Astable Multivibrator PCB - KiCad Design
A simple transistor-based astable multivibrator circuit that generates a continuous square wave.


 Project Overview
This PCB design implements an astable multivibrator using two NPN transistors (e.g., BC547), resistors, and capacitors. The circuit oscillates continuously, producing a square wave without any external trigger.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Frequency Control: Adjustable via resistors (R1, R2) and capacitors (C1, C2).

LED Blinking: Includes LEDs for visual oscillation feedback.

KiCad Design: Schematic + PCB layout (supports Gerber export for manufacturing).
